# Logistics Performance Analytics

This project simulates a data analytics pipeline for logistics performance analysis.

The goal is to build an end-to-end solution using SQL and Python to extract insights from a fictional delivery company dataset.

## About the Project

This repository was created as part of my Data Analyst portfolio.

Here I simulate the data environment of a logistics company, including:

- +1000 deliveries
- 50 drivers
- 200 customers
- Routes and delivery incidents

The focus is on building a full analytics process — from raw data to insights — using real-world tools and techniques.
